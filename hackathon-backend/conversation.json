Based on the Annual Information Statement (AIS) Summary, Bank Statement Summary, and Multi-Bureau Aggregated API Data, I'll provide a comprehensive evaluation of the applicant's credit risk profile.\n\nThe applicant has a diversified income stream, including rent, dividend, and interest from savings bank. They have also made high-value transactions, such as purchasing and selling immovable properties. The average monthly credit is \u20b9 21,516.25, and the average monthly debit is \u20b9 74,356,350, indicating high volatility due to large transactions in immovable properties.\n\nThe creditworthiness assessment suggests a good credit history with a credit score of 770. However, the applicant has a high debt-to-income ratio and significant liabilities, which may impact their creditworthiness.\n\nConsidering these factors, the recommended lending decision is \"Approve with Conditions.\" The suggested lending terms are:\n\n* Maximum Loan Amount: \u20b9 2,00,00,000\n* Interest Rate Range: 8.5% - 10.5%\n* Tenure: 5 years\n* Collateral Requirement: Yes, immovable property worth \u20b9 1,00,00,000\n\nTo mitigate the identified risks, I recommend the following:\n\n* Shorter loan tenure\n* Mandatory collateral\n* Guarantor requirement\n* EMI auto-debit mandates\n\nHow would you like to proceed with the loan application? Would you like to discuss the conditions or explore other options?"

The applicant has a good credit history, a stable income stream, and a strong net worth, which indicates a low risk of default. However, the high debt-to-income ratio and significant liabilities may impact their creditworthiness.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, I suggest the following lending terms:\n\n* Maximum Loan Amount: \u20b9 2,00,00,000\n* Interest Rate Range: 8.5% - 10.5%\n* Tenure: 5 years\n* Collateral Requirement: Yes, immovable property worth \u20b9 1,00,00,000\n\nAdditionally, I recommend implementing risk mitigation strategies, such as:\n\n* Shorter loan tenure\n* Mandatory collateral\n* Guarantor requirement\n* EMI auto-debit mandates\n\nBy approving the loan with these conditions, you can minimize the risks associated with lending to this applicant while still providing them with the necessary funds.\n\nConsidering the high volatility in the applicant's financial transactions, it is essential to closely monitor their credit behavior and adjust the lending terms accordingly.\n\nAs we previously discussed, the applicant has a diversified income stream and a strong net worth, which are positive factors in their creditworthiness assessment. However, the high debt-to-income ratio and significant liabilities require careful consideration and mitigation.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I would like to ask: Are you comfortable with the level of risk associated with lending to this applicant, and do you have any concerns or questions regarding the recommended lending terms or risk mitigation strategies?"
